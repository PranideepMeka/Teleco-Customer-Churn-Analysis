# Teleco-Customer-Churn-Analysis
This is an IBM generated Project
# 📉 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting customer churn using machine learning to help telecom companies improve retention strategies.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset provided by IBM to predict whether a customer will leave the company or not. The model helps identify high-risk customers so proactive steps can be taken to retain them.

**Key Objectives:**
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess the data and engineer relevant features
- Train various machine learning models
- Evaluate and compare model performance
- Interpret the results using explainable AI techniques
- (Optional) Deploy the model via Streamlit or Flask
